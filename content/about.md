Hello! My name is Kenny Van de Maele, currently [26](. "note to self: add a code snippet to automatically calculate my age so I don't have to update this number in the future") years old.

I live in the city of [Aalst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drLmRc51Lbw), in Flanders, Belgium.

I'm currently working at [Adimian](https://adimian.com) as a Senior DevOps Engineer.

Some of the things I specialise in are:
- "Oldschool" Linux System Administration
	- CentOS/RedHat Enterprise Linux
	- Deploying and maintaining bare-metal and virtual systems
	- Administrating VMware, XenServer, RHEV hypervisors
	- Physical hardware installations
	- Monitoring and alerting (Icinga2 etc.)
- Working closely together with in-house development (java, python, ...)
- Modernising existing in-house stacks
	- Applying new tooling to existing workflows and applications
	- Guiding development with migrations to new-age technologies such as Docker/K8S and AWS.
	- Identifying and fixing weak points in (not so) High-Available applications
- Logging (ELK)
- Networking (CCNA-level+ understanding of low-level communications both on metal equipment and cloud shenanigans)
- Scripting and automating
- I'm moderately proficient in Python3, but I'm not focused on development.

Languages I (somewhat) speak:
- Dutch/Flemish (Native speaker)
- English (Highly proficient in all aspects)
- French (_Je tire mon plan._ Not very fluent.)

## Origins

Born in the early 90s in a family with only modest means, I grew up around already aging computers.

I have a few vague memories of using Windows 3.11, but my first real computer was a Pentium II IBM, running Windows NT 4.0.
At an early age, and without much internet access I played around in Microsoft Frontpage 97 to make websites nobody would ever see, and work out how to do basic things in Visual Basic 6.

This interest grew into a few years of _lightly_ abusing poorly set-up school networks, and making myself administrator on school computers. Fun times were had.

Around 2007, aged 14, I finally received a modern computer. It was a glorious low-end Pentium E Dual-Core. I made the leap from Windows 2000 to... Vista. _oh no._

Frustrated with the color blue, I discovered something called "Linux". It didn't take long before I had liberated my computer, and simultaneously made my life a bit more incompatible with a very microsoft-oriented school system.

I started out with Ubuntu 8.04 , and learned to do things the hard (but satisfying) way. 
I still appreciate ubuntu for what it is, but all my personal systems are now running Arch Linux. In the professional world my experience lies with CentOS/Redhat.

In highschool, I took the "Industrial ICT" specialisation, and learned a lot about electronics and computers in general. I developed an interest in microcontrollers and custom circuits, and for my 6th year final project, I built a computer-controlled car with WLAN capabilities, with motor-controllers and microcontroller firmware of my own design. It sported an IP Cam on the top, and is still an accomplishment I'm very proud of. Unfortunately I've lost all information and pictures regarding this project.


College was a more turbulent time for me. Wanting to continue my interest in electronics and robotics, I started an Industrial Engineering degree at Howest Kortrijk, but was very quickly demotivated by the level of the hard sciences, which I had a lacking background of from my technical education. I bowed out from this school, and started a more modest Bachelor's degree in Applied IT at Erasmushogeschool Brussels.

Some of the courses came very natural to me, some of them not so much. Networking, Operating Systems, System Administration, C++ programming, felt easy and fun, but later theory-heavy programming courses like C#.net and advanced OOP Java which forced me to color within the lines of the pre-defined approved Design Patterns were a source of frustration to me. I had a lot of disagreements with my professors, and grew very demotivated in my school career.

Because of obscure reasons, during my 3rd year I wasn't able to take a full load of courses, and had about 2 or 3 days free from classes.
I took advantage of this free time by applying for an intern-level student job at a company focused on open source technology. 

Here I was thrown in the deep-end, and I got a number of assignments thrown at me regarding their monitoring system and some of their internal linux infrastructure. I managed to swim, and learned a lot by doing in the first few months I spent there. Being more invested in this work than finishing my education, I asked management to hire me full-time, and the rest of my 3 years there are history. I don't regret this decision at all, as it fast-tracked my career, and I'm positive I wouldn't be where I am today if I had spent the next year (or longer) finishing up my bachelor's degree.

In the 3 years I spent there, I had a number of different consultancy assignments at different companies, usually working together with internal development, or on the infrastructure teams. 
It was a very mixed bag of experiences, and I'm glad to have been exposed to this smörgåsbord of technologies and teams.

In the summer of 2019, I joined [Adimian](https://adimian.com) as a now "Senior" DevOps Engineer, and I'm currently on assignment with another in-house python development team, guiding their transition to AWS.
