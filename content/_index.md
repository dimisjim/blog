This is a personal blog which will hopefully soon contain things I find interesting and wish to share with the world.
Most of the content will hopefully relate to my experiences with:
- Linux and other FOSS Operating systems in the wild
- Interesting stacks of FOSS software
- Deploying, monitoring, automating the previous things

I'm sure I will deviate from this, and include posts about personal hobbies and interests such as:
- 3D printing
- Beer, and the drinking of it
- Audio engineering


You can also read more [about](/about/) me, or [contact](/contact) me.

Please don't abuse my contact details to send me unsolicited job offers or other spam.
