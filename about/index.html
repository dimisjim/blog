At an early age, and without much internet access I played around in Microsoft Frontpage 97 to make websites nobody would ever see, and work out how to do basic things in Visual Basic 6.</p><p>This interest grew into a few years of <em>lightly</em> abusing poorly set-up school networks, and making myself administrator on school computers. Fun times were had.</p><p>Around 2007, aged 14, I finally received a modern computer. It was a glorious low-end Pentium E Dual-Core. I made the leap from Windows 2000 to&mldr; Vista. <em>oh no.</em></p><p>Frustrated with the color blue, I discovered something called &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;. It didn&rsquo;t take long before I had liberated my computer, and simultaneously made my life a bit more incompatible with a very microsoft-oriented school system.</p><p>I started out with Ubuntu 8.04 , and learned to do things the hard (but satisfying) way.
I still appreciate ubuntu for what it is, but all my personal systems are now running Arch Linux. In the professional world my experience lies with CentOS/Redhat.</p><p>In highschool, I took the &ldquo;Industrial ICT&rdquo; specialisation, and learned a lot about electronics and computers in general. I developed an interest in microcontrollers and custom circuits, and for my 6th year final project, I built a computer-controlled car with WLAN capabilities, with motor-controllers and microcontroller firmware of my own design. It sported an IP Cam on the top, and is still an accomplishment I&rsquo;m very proud of. Unfortunately I&rsquo;ve lost all information and pictures regarding this project.</p><p>College was a more turbulent time for me. Wanting to continue my interest in electronics and robotics, I started an Industrial Engineering degree at Howest Kortrijk, but was very quickly demotivated by the level of the hard sciences, which I had a lacking background of from my technical education. I bowed out from this school, and started a more modest Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Applied IT at Erasmushogeschool Brussels.</p><p>Some of the courses came very natural to me, some of them not so much. Networking, Operating Systems, System Administration, C++ programming, felt easy and fun, but later theory-heavy programming courses like C#.net and advanced OOP Java which forced me to color within the lines of the pre-defined approved Design Patterns were a source of frustration to me. I had a lot of disagreements with my professors, and grew very demotivated in my school career.</p><p>Because of obscure reasons, during my 3rd year I wasn&rsquo;t able to take a full load of courses, and had about 2 or 3 days free from classes.
I took advantage of this free time by applying for an intern-level student job at a company focused on open source technology.</p><p>Here I was thrown in the deep-end, and I got a number of assignments thrown at me regarding their monitoring system and some of their internal linux infrastructure. I managed to swim, and learned a lot by doing in the first few months I spent there. Being more invested in this work than finishing my education, I asked management to hire me full-time, and the rest of my 3 years there are history. I don&rsquo;t regret this decision at all, as it fast-tracked my career, and I&rsquo;m positive I wouldn&rsquo;t be where I am today if I had spent the next year (or longer) finishing up my bachelor&rsquo;s degree.</p><p>In the 3 years I spent there, I had a number of different consultancy assignments at different companies, usually working together with internal development, or on the infrastructure teams.
It was a very mixed bag of experiences, and I&rsquo;m glad to have been exposed to this smörgåsbord of technologies and teams.</p><p>In the summer of 2019, I joined <a href=https://adimian.com>Adimian</a> as a now &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; DevOps Engineer, and I&rsquo;m currently on assignment with another in-house python development team, guiding their transition to AWS.</p><p><img src=https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cautionary.png alt=linux></p></div></main><footer><div>&copy; Kenny Van de Maele 2020
